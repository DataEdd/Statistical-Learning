Suppose that in our role as statistical consultants we are asked to suggest,
on the basis of this data, a marketing plan for next year that will result in
high product sales. What information would be useful in order to provide
such a recommendation? Here are a few important questions that we might
seek to address:
1. Is there a relationship between advertising budget and sales?
Our first goal should be to determine whether the data provide evi-
dence of an association between advertising expenditure and sales. If
the evidence is weak, then one might argue that no money should be
spent on advertising!
2. How strong is the relationship between advertising budget and sales?
Assuming that there is a relationship between advertising and sales,
we would like to know the strength of this relationship. Does knowl-
edge of the advertising budget provide a lot of information about
product sales?
3. Which media are associated with sales?
Are all three media—TV, radio, and newspaper—associated with
sales, or are just one or two of the media associated? To answer this
question, we must find a way to separate out the individual contribu-
tion of each medium to sales when we have spent money on all three
media.
4. How large is the association between each medium and sales?
For every dollar spent on advertising in a particular medium, by
what amount will sales increase? How accurately can we predict this
amount of increase?
5. How accurately can we predict future sales?
For any given level of television, radio, or newspaper advertising, what
is our prediction for sales, and what is the accuracy of this prediction?
6. Is the relationship linear?
If there is approximately a straight-line relationship between advertis-
ing expenditure in the various media and sales, then linear regression
is an appropriate tool. If not, then it may still be possible to trans-
form the predictor or the response so that linear regression can be
used.
7. Is there synergy among the advertising media?
Perhaps spending $50,000 on television advertising and $50,000 on ra-
dio advertising is associated with higher sales than allocating $100,000
to either television or radio individually. In marketing, this is known
as a synergy effect, while in statistics it is called an interaction effect
